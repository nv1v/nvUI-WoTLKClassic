## Summary
> Custom add-ons created and used by Nviv for World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King Classic. These add-ons or variantions of them have been used throughout Burning Crusade Classic & Live Shadowlands (not included here) and are in mostly working conditions.

## Installation
1. Download latest release [Releases](https://github.com/nv1v/nvUI-WoTLKClassic/releases)
2. Extract folder from release
3. Delete ReadMe.md
4. Move add-on(s) to AddOns folder in WoW Directory (e.g `C:/ProgramFiles/WorldofWarcraft/_classic/Interface/AddOns/`)
5. Login to WoW and enable the add-ons from the Addons or Interface menu.

## Features
An addon that statically adjusts the position and opacity of the default UI elements. Some of these elments include:  
- Unit Frames(Player, Target, TargetofTarget, Class Coloring)
- Player Cast Bars(Scale, Remove Border/Clean)
- MiniMap(Enable Mouse-wheel Zoom, Opacity)
- Nameplates(Class Coloring)
- Action Bar, Primary + Secondary(Scale, Position, Opacity)
- Action Bar, Top-left + Top-right(Scale, Position, Opacity)
- Action Bar, Utility / Far-Right Corner(Scale, Position, Opacity)
- Menu Buttons(Scale, Position, Opacity)
- PetBar(Scale, Position, Opacity)
- ExperienceBar(Scale, Position, Opacity)
- Hotkey Keybinds(Adjusts the formatting of text on keybinds)

## Notes
- Typing "/ms" in the in-game chat will print your current latency(ms).
- The core.lua scripts for each add-on are fairly well commented and position/opacity variables can be lightly adjusted.
- The core.lua scripts have a "verbosemode" variable that is set to 1 by default. Set this to 0 to prevent output to the console at login.
    
## 🄳🄸🅂🄲🄻🄰🄸🄼🄴🅁 
- I use UI Scale 0.6 and recommend doing the same if using these addons...
- Most changes are made to my personal tastes, and may or may not be useful to others.
- These add-ons were tested and work with my version of WoW. YMMV.

Good luck! o7   -Nviv
